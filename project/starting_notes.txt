Trying to make sense of this project rn 

dh = diffie-Hellman

> Need to impliment handshaking between hw/sw.
    - Do this with enable-done in dh_hw & dh_sw

> Example handshaking in hardware: 
    - HW wait for hw_enable = true from SW 
    - HW performs computation [NN_DigitDiv()]
    - HW asserts hw_done = true 
    - SW deasserts hw_enable & HW deasserts hw_done

> To do list for HW:
    - add a clock input
    - FSM with 3 states:
    1. WAIT: 
        deassert hw_done = false and wait for hw_enable = true 
        then go to EXECUTE
    2. EXECUTE: 
        read input, do computations and write output while keeping
        hw_done = false then go to FINISH
    3. FINISH:
        make hw_done = true and wait for hw_enable = false
        then go to WAIT


> EXECUTE will have a few states within it:
    1. INPUT:
        assert load input; to to EXE_R0
    2.


> WHAT I CHANGED
    - changed sc_fifo channels to sc_in/out in dh_sw.h 
    - added hw_done sensitivity to dh_sw
    - changed sc_fifo channels to sc_in/out in dh_hw.h
    - changed sc_fifo channels to sc_signal in dhdemo.cpp


    - Added the WAIT, EXECUTE and FINISH case statement to dh_hw.cpp

    - Added handshaking to NN_DigitDivHH() just following slides
    

    - added test clock to dhdemo.cpp as linked it to dh_hw clock
